This is a Repository for a Python File Manager script, and as of now, allows you to read a file,
write to a file, add to a file, delete a file, list files in a directory, check a file's existence,
move a file, copy a file, create a directory, delete a directory and open a program.

To Convert the .py file into a .exe file, I used this tutorial:

I hope it will help anyone who needs it!
